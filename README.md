# quake-gen
basic map generator for Quake 1. 
Generates a series of rooms connected via doors. Rooms vary by type and can be unpredictable.
Not all maps are possible to finish. Lots of bugs as of now.

Virtually all code was made by AI, there's no license on this code. AI mapping will never surpass human made maps, and this should only ever be taken as a proof of concept.
