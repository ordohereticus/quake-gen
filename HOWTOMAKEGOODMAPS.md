That's a very complicated question, but I'll try and answer it.

First, it's a good idea to get an understanding for yourself of what you like in maps. Mapping is a creative pursuit, meaning that "good" is largely subjective, so you might want to play some existing custom maps (as well as, of course, the original campaign) to get a feel for what you like to see in a map and what you want to do with your own maps.

On the technical side, dumptruck_ds has an excellent tutorial series for making maps using TrenchBroom. I won't go into more detail here both because he has already done it far better than I could and because it isn't really what you were asking about if I interpreted your question correctly. Also check out the Quake Mapping Discord for help and discussion surrounding Quake and general mapping and for updates on new releases and events. Now, in no particular order, onto some other things you should consider:

Scale. You can very easily end up making your paths and doorways either too small or far too big. It's a good idea to have a run around your map early on (even when you only have a few brushes down) to make sure it feels about right. If a shambler can comfortably run around most of your map, you're probably not too small. Quake has a very limited number of hitbox sizes, meaning that despite looking small, a fiend actually needs at least as much space as a shambler.

Loops. In a well designed map, you will find yourself revisiting earlier areas, often multiple times, not by backtracking but because the mapper has led you back there around a looping path, recontextualising it with the keys, weapons or switches you find along the way. It can sometimes feel like magic to suddenly realise that you've ended up in a familiar place from a new perspective.

Pacing. A good map isn't non-stop action. You want some areas to be tense and others to be less so, but you also don't want the difficulty to be spiking all over the place. This can be tricky, so just think about splitting it into combat and exploration sections, and consider how you want the player to be feeling at any given point, using the presence or absence of items and monsters to influence this, obviously with the difficulty generally rising as new weapons and enemies are introduced.

Lighting/composition/detailing. I've grouped these together because they work together to improve the look and feel of a map and make it nicer to navigate. Don't neglect lighting; it's important! This is also a broad category, so I've put some more general ideas here too. At the most basic level, you want to light up points of interest, especially the critical path, so that people are naturally aware of and drawn to them. Contrast (in lighting and other aspects of the map) can be used to draw interest and generally make the map more visually or otherwise appealing. You can also use leading lines and colour to move the player's attention. You get a lot of very detailed maps, but you need to be careful to have a generally consistent level of detail throughout the map, and to not have random background details that deceptively look important. For those things, having them darker and with less contrast can be helpful. Background movement in your map is a nice thing to have, as are ambient sounds, and they can give your map a better sense of space. Also on the topic of composition, you usually want to avoid a branching path where the player feels like they're missing out on something unknown by committing to a path. You can do so by building trust with them using looping paths before such a junction, or by clearly indicating to them which is the main path and which is optional/secret, using techniques discussed. If two paths are equally important (such as if you want to player to find two keys or buttons in a nonlinear fashion,) then it's good to communicate this clearly using symmetry.

Verticality. You want to play to the strengths of Quake in general, and among the greatest of those strengths is that it allows you to add a lot of verticality to your layouts, unlike, for example, Doom, which could not have one walkable area directly above another. This allows you to create some really interesting layouts, where you return to the same area but from higher up, or where an area or item is inaccessible early on because it is too high for you to reach. This is one of the main reasons I love this game and its mapping scene so much. Just remember that many players of most games have a tendency to almost never look up, so it might be necessary to encourage them to do so in creative ways.

Balance. The main difference between the difficulty levels in Quake is up to the mapper. You can select on which difficulties individual enemies, items, weapons and even doors, lights and more technical things spawn, which really gives you a lot of power to balance for different difficulty levels in creative ways besides just adding or removing some monsters. You can change the amount of resources the player gets, how early weapons are introduced, the angles monsters come from and more. E2M2 for instance has a path at the end which requires you to jump some gaps only on hard difficulty. Keep in mind that, having played through every encounter countless times while creating them, you will often have an easier time with your map than other people. Make sure you get playtesters involved at multiple stages in development to get the balance right, as well as to find and resolve any issues. Use the Screenshots & Betas thread on the func_msgboard forum or the #screenshots-and-testing channel in the Quake Mapping Discord to find testers and get feedback. Avoid being too precious about your maps, and try and use the feedback to make changes to and improve your work. Also don't be afraid to iterate on or redo areas of your map.

Idk if there's something essential I missed but that's all I can think of for now, so there you go I guess.

What made them stand out?

What made it fun?

From there, it's just a game of getting the layout and playtesting.

Also don't forget that sweet verticality. This is quake mapping after all, not Doom.

lead people around with items. It creates familiar paths for people to navigate

Something that has a good flow to it. It shouldnâ€™t just be rooms connected to more rooms. It needs to tell a story. Try to make good scenery. Or layouts that have uniqueness to them. The cool thing about mapping is that you can literally project your fantasy onto something real. Make it as interesting as possible.
